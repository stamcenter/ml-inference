# FHE Benchmarking Suite - ML Inference
This repository contains the harness for the ML-inference workload of the FHE benchmarking suite of [HomomorphicEncryption.org](https://www.HomomorphicEncryption.org).
The harness currently supports mnist model benchmarking as specified in `harness/mnist` directory.
The `main` branch contains a reference implementation of this workload, under the `submission` subdirectory.
The harness also supports an optional *remote backend execution mode* under the `submission_remote` subdirectory, where the homomorphic evaluation is executed on a remote backend.

Submitters need to clone this repository, replace the content of the `submission` or `submission_remote` subdirectory by their own implementation.
They also may need to changes or replace the script `scripts/build_task.sh` to account for dependencies and build environment for their submission.
Submitters are expected to document any changes made to the model architecture `harness/mnist/mnist.py` in the `submission/README.md` file. 

## Execution Modes

The ML Inference benchmark supports two execution modes:

### Local Execution (Default)

All steps are executed on a single machine:
- Cryptographic context setup and model preprocessing
- Key generation
- Input preprocessing and encryption
- Homomorphic inference
- Decryption and postprocessing

This corresponds to the reference submission in `submission/`.

### Remote Backend Execution (Optional)

Some FHE deployments separate client-side and server-side responsibilities.  
In this mode:

- **Client-side (local):**
  - Key generation
  - Input preprocessing and encryption
  - Decryption and postprocessing

- **Server-side (remote):**
  - Cryptographic context setup and model preprocessing
  - Homomorphic inference

This execution mode is enabled by passing the `--remote` flag to the harness.

## Running the ML-inference workload

#### Dependencies
- Python 3.12+
- The build environment for local execution depends on OpenFHE being installed as specified in `scripts/get_openfhe.sh` and `submission/CMakeLists.txt`. See https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development#installation.
- The build environment for remote-backend execution depends on lattica-query being installed as specified in `submission_remote/requirements.txt`. See https://platformdocs.lattica.ai/how-to-guides/client-installation/how-to-install-query-client. Should be installed on a `linux_x86_64` machine.

#### Execution
To run the workload, clone and install dependencies:
```console
git clone https://github.com/fhe-benchmarking/ml-inference.git
cd ml-inference

python -m venv bmenv
source ./bmenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 harness/run_submission.py -h  # Information about command-line options
```

The harness script `harness/run_submission.py` will attempt to build the submission itself, if it is not already built. If already built, it will use the same project without re-building it (unless the code has changed). An example run is provided below.


```console
$ python3 harness/run_submission.py -h
usage: run_submission.py [-h] [--num_runs NUM_RUNS] [--seed SEED] [--clrtxt CLRTXT] [--remote] {0,1,2,3}

Run ML Inference FHE benchmark.

positional arguments:
  {0,1,2,3}            Instance size (0-single/1-small/2-medium/3-large)

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --num_runs NUM_RUNS  Number of times to run steps 4-9 (default: 1)
  --seed SEED          Random seed for dataset and query generation
  --clrtxt CLRTXT      Specify with 1 if to rerun the cleartext computation
  --remote             Specify if to run in remote-backend mode
```

The single instance runs the inference for a single input and verifies the correctness of the obtained label compared to the ground-truth label.

```console
$ python3 ./harness/run_submission.py 0 --seed 3 --num_runs 2

The batch inference cases run the inference for a batch of inputs of varying sizes. The accuracy (with respect to the ground truth labels) is compared between the decrypted results and the results obtained using the harness model.

Submitters must overwrite the contents of the `scripts` and `submissions`

## Description of stages

A submitter can edit any of the `client_*` / `server_*` sources in `/submission`. 
Moreover, for the particular parameters related to a workload, the submitter can modify the params files.
If the current description of the files are inaccurate, the stage names in `run_submission` can be also 
modified.

The current stages are the following, targeted to a client-server scenario.
The order in which they are happening in `run_submission` assumes an initialization step which is 
database-dependent and run only once, and potentially multiple runs for multiple queries.
Each file can take as argument the test case size.


| Stage executables                | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `server_get_params`              | (Optional) Get cryptographic context from a remote server.
| `client_key_generation`          | Generate all key material and cryptographic context at the client.           
| `server_upload_ek`               | (Optional) Upload evaluation key to a remote backend.
| `client_preprocess_dataset`      | (Optional) Any in the clear computations the client wants to apply over the dataset/model.
| `client_preprocess_input`        | (Optional) Any in the clear computations the client wants to apply over the input.
| `client_encode_encrypt_query`    | Plaintext encoding and encryption of the input at the client.
| `server_preprocess_model`        | (Optional) Any in the clear or encrypted computations the server wants to apply over the model.
| `server_encrypted_compute`       | The computation the server applies to achieve the workload solution over encrypted data.
| `client_decrypt_decode`          | Decryption and plaintext decoding of the result at the client.
| `client_postprocess`             | Any in the clear computation that the client wants to apply on the decrypted result.


The outer python script measures the runtime of each stage.
The current stage separation structure requires reading and writing to files more times than minimally necessary.
For a more granular runtime measuring, which would account for the extra overhead described above, we encourage
submitters to separate and print in a log the individual times for reads/writes and computations inside each stage.
